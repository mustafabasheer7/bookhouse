BookHouse project using Open Library API, React JS, and Tailwind CSS.
***
## **View Application:**
https://bookhouse-6697b.web.app/
***
## **Notes:**
#### 1. I am displaying 10 books per subject, I could do more/less. Another option would be having some sort of a button, and when it is clicked, I load more books.
#### 2. I used the common subjects (subjects on home page) from Open Library API listed in this page: (https://openlibrary.org/subjects).
#### 3. There are two different ways to fetch works in a subject from the API (either "/subject/{subjectName}" such as "Film" or "search?q={...}") such as "World War II". I used the same format that was used in the subjects page (https://openlibrary.org/subjects).
#### 3. The application is responsive and can be viewed on any screen.
#### 4. "search for a book feature" is not implemented yet, I might work on it later.
#### 5. I deployed the project on Firebase (see link above).
